# 🤖 n8n Automation Portfolio

A collection of production-ready AI automation workflows built with n8n, OpenAI, and complementary tools. Each project solves a real business problem — lead generation, customer support, competitive intelligence, and more.

Every folder is a self-contained case study: a README with the problem it solves and
the result, an architecture diagram, the exported workflow JSON, and a node-by-node
walkthrough. Click any project below.

## 📂 Projects

| Project | The problem it solves | Stack |
|---------|-----------------------|-------|
| [outbound-feedback-bot](./outbound-feedback-bot/) | **An AI rep that calls your customers.** Dials existing customers by phone, checks in on their last order, **reads sentiment**, **qualifies new opportunities**, then logs *every* call to a sheet and emails *only* the qualified leads — with **opt-out / do-not-call** honored automatically (skipped before dial, auto-added on request). | Vapi · n8n · Twilio · GPT-4o-mini · Google Sheets · Gmail |
| [ai-voice-front-desk](./ai-voice-front-desk/) | **A receptionist that answers the phone.** Handles inbound calls by voice — qualifies, **books mid-call** with round-robin across staff + an availability guard (no double-booking), confirms + SMSes, and **transfers to a human** on request. Also runs **outbound**, dialing a lead list with a personalized pitch — plus a **Vapi realtime upgrade** that runs the same booking brain behind streaming speech-to-speech (~840ms latency) for a natural, low-lag inbound call. | Twilio · **Vapi** · n8n · GPT-4o-mini · Google Calendar · Sheets |
| [mcp-personal-assistant](./mcp-personal-assistant/) | **Scattered daily tasks → one chat.** A single agent reaches calendar, email, sheets, notes, web search, and math over MCP — picking the right tool itself, gating irreversible actions. | MCP · GPT-4o-mini · Supabase · n8n |
| [competitor-intelligence](./competitor-intelligence/) | **Replaces a $100s/mo SaaS.** Tracks competitors daily, uses AI to surface *only what changed* (hash-diff keeps it cents/day), and ships a sectioned weekly brief + a RAG chat — across 3 businesses. | n8n · OpenAI · Supabase/pgvector · Slack |
| [whatsapp-lead-qualifier](./whatsapp-lead-qualifier/) | **No inbound lead goes cold.** Answers WhatsApp leads instantly 24/7, runs a full BANT qualification, saves state per phone (resumable), then routes hot leads to a booking link + Slack alert. | n8n · OpenAI · Supabase · WhatsApp · Slack |
| [rag-support-chatbot](./rag-support-chatbot/) | **Support answers that don't hallucinate.** Auto-syncs a Google Drive folder into a vector store and answers *only* from those docs — cites the source file, refuses what isn't documented. | n8n · OpenAI · Supabase/pgvector · Google Drive |
| [social-content-bot](./social-content-bot/) | **Autoposting with a human gate.** Turns one idea into platform-tailored posts, self-critiques for quality, then *pauses* for Slack Approve/Decline before publishing — and logs the live link back. | n8n · OpenAI · Google Sheets · Slack · Ayrshare |
| [ai-email-triage](./ai-email-triage/) | **An inbox that sorts itself.** Classifies every email, then routes it — Slack-alerts the urgent, **drafts replies for review**, flags leads, files newsletters, bins spam — and tags each `triaged` so it's never handled twice. Nothing is sent without a human. | n8n · OpenAI · Gmail · Slack |
| [email-lead-qualifier](./email-lead-qualifier/) | **No inbound email lead goes cold.** Scores every email against BANT, routes it **hot / warm / dismiss**, captures leads to a database + tracker sheet, alerts Slack — and sends an instant, temperature-aware acknowledgment. The warm path captures *incomplete* inquiries instead of dropping them. | n8n · OpenAI · Supabase · Gmail · Slack · Sheets |
| [crm-lead-engine](./crm-lead-engine/) | **A CRM that cleans itself and captures every lead.** Two AI lanes on one **HubSpot** CRM: a scheduled agent that enriches + scores existing contacts (infers company/seniority from what's already there — no external data-append), and an inbound lane that qualifies emails, writes leads into HubSpot, routes by temperature, and auto-replies to hot/warm. | n8n · OpenAI · HubSpot · Gmail · Slack |
| [telegram-agent](./telegram-agent/) | **Hands-free assistant in Telegram.** Takes voice or text, transcribes with Whisper, and routes to tools for calendar, email, and web search — replying by text or audio. | n8n · GPT-4o · Telegram · Whisper |

> 🎥 Short demo videos for each workflow are on the way — to be added in one pass once all builds are complete.
